        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>
        <li>Yogurt</li>

        <li>Saffron</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the rice thoroughly and soak it in water for about 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Marinate the chicken pieces in yogurt, biriyani masala, ginger-garlic paste, and salt for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat ghee or oil in a large pan. Add sliced onions and cook until golden brown. Remove half of the onions and set aside for garnish.</li>
        <li>Add the marinated chicken to the pan and cook until it turns golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they are soft and mushy.</li>

        <li>In the same pot used for cooking rice, layer half of the partially cooked rice at the bottom. Then add a layer of the cooked chicken masala.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers with the remaining rice and chicken masala. Sprinkle the saffron-infused milk on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes until the rice is fully cooked and aromatic.</li>
        <li>Once done, gently fluff up the biriyani with a fork. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves and fried onions.</li>

    <h1>Tips</h1>
    <p>Preparation is Key: Ensure that all your ingredients are prepped and ready before you start cooking. This includes marinating the chicken, soaking the rice, and chopping the onions and tomatoes. Proper preparation saves time and ensures a smoother cooking process.</p><br>
    <p>Layering for Flavor: Pay attention to the layering of rice and chicken masala in the pot. Alternate layers ensure that every spoonful of biriyani is packed with flavor. Additionally, sprinkle some fried onions, chopped mint, and coriander leaves between the layers to enhance the taste and aroma.</p><br>
    <p>Perfectly Cooked Rice: Achieving the right texture for the rice is crucial. Parboil the rice until it's about 70-80% cooked before layering it with the chicken masala. This ensures that the rice grains remain separate and fluffy, without becoming mushy or overcooked during the final cooking process. Also, avoid stirring the biriyani once it's assembled in the pot to prevent the rice from breaking.</p><br>

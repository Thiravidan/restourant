    <h1>Tips</h1>
    <p>Marinate the Chicken: Before cooking, marinate the chicken in a mixture of soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and a splash of sesame oil for added flavor and tenderness..</p><br>
    <p>Don't Overcook the Vegetables: To maintain the vibrant colors and crunch of the vegetables, avoid overcooking them. Stir-fry just until they are tender-crisp to preserve their texture and nutrients.</p><br>
    <p>Customize with Spices: Experiment with spices and seasonings to tailor the dish to your taste preferences. Add a pinch of chili flakes for heat, a dash of five-spice powder for depth, or a squeeze of lime for acidity. Adjust the seasoning to achieve the perfect balance of flavors.</p> <br>
